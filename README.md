# StatComp18055
StatComp18055 is a simple R package which includes four R functions for the ‘Statistical Computing’ course: CVM.test (test for equal distributions in the univariate case), my.pcauchy (compute the cdf of the Cauchy distribution), my.chisq.test(a faster version of chisq.test() that only computes the chi-square test statistic when the input is two numeric vectors with no missing values) and my.table(a faster version of table() for the case of an input of two integer vectors with no missing values).

You can install this package by following command：devtools::install_github("liudandan1996/StatComp18055")
